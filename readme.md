# LicketyRESPLIT: Fast Rashomon Set Approximation for Sparse Decision Trees

LicketyRESPLIT is a high-performance C++/Python library for rapidly enumerating all decision trees within a multiplier of the best tree (or reference solution).

LicketyRESPLIT can generates millions of valid trees in seconds, orders of magnitudes faster than other approaches.

Installation:
```
pip install "git+https://github.com/zakk-h/LicketyRESPLIT.git"
```

See [`examples/example.ipynb`](examples/example.ipynb) for a complete walkthrough of using LicketyRESPLIT.
